<!-- To keep your forked repo updated, please fetch upstream every time we release a new lab assignment. If you are not familiar with fetch, please check out this [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork). -->

# Getting Started

> **ECE 346 students:** please fork this repository and work within your own forked repo (see instructions below). 


## Connect to the robot
The robot can be used as a standalone Ubuntu computer by plugging in a keyboard, a mouse, and a monitor through an HDMI or DP cable. 

Alternatively, you can remotely access the robot’s terminal through SSH, provided that both the robot and the computer are under the same network. If you are connected to the lab’s **ECE346** wifi, we provide detailed [instructions](asset/ssh.md) on how to SSH into the robot using one of the lab workstations or your own laptop.

## Create your private fork
We encourage each group to create a _private_ fork to host your code, and make a clone on your group's robot, by following these [instructions](asset/private_fork.md). Please include your group number in the name of your repo.

# [Lab 0 - Introduction](ROS_ws/src/lab0)
Lab 0 gives an introduction to ROS and the mobile robot platform used in this class.

# [Lab 2 - Forward Reachable Set](ROS_ws/src/lab2)
Lab 2 allows students to plan trajectory that follows given path and avoids obstacles.
