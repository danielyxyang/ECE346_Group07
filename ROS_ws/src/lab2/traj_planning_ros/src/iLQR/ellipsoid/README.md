ellReach is a toolbox for computing ellipsoidal reachable sets of dynamical systems. This toolbox is primarily developed by [Haimin Hu](https://haiminhu.org/), a PhD student in the [Safe Robotics Lab](https://saferobotics.princeton.edu), and inspired by the [Ellipsoidal Toolbox (MATLAB)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/21936-ellipsoidal-toolbox-et) developed by Dr. Alex Kurzhanskiy.
